# Space-Invader-Game
A simple but great game powered by Java's JavaFX
I am thrilled to showcase my latest project, SpaceInvader, a JavaFX- and AI-powered game that I developed. This project is the culmination of my passion for both programming and gaming. I wanted to create a game that would challenge players' skills while also incorporating cutting-edge technology.

SpaceInvader is a classic arcade-style game that takes players on a journey through space, where they must fight off waves of invading alien spacecraft. The game features stunning graphics and sound effects, which I designed using JavaFX, a powerful and versatile platform for developing user interfaces.

What sets SpaceInvader apart from other arcade games is the integration of AI technology. I incorporated a machine learning algorithm that allows the game to adapt to the player's skills and provide a more challenging experience as they progress. This feature adds a new level of excitement and unpredictability to the game.

Overall, I am incredibly proud of what I was able to achieve with SpaceInvader. It combines my love of gaming and programming and showcases my skills in developing complex software solutions. I hope that others will enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed creating it.
