## Prerequisites
- JDK 11 or higher.
- JavaFX SDK (version compatible with your JDK).

## Setup and Installation
1. **JavaFX SDK**: Download the JavaFX SDK from [OpenJFX](https://openjfx.io/) and extract it to a known directory.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone <repository-url>` to clone this repository to your local machine.

## Configuration
Ensure JavaFX is correctly set up in your development environment:
- **IntelliJ IDEA**:
    1. Go to `File` > `Project Structure` > `Libraries`, add the JavaFX SDK as a library by navigating to its `lib` folder.
    2. Modify your run configuration to include VM options for the JavaFX modules you use, e.g., `--module-path "path/to/javafx-sdk/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media`.

- **Eclipse**:
    1. Add the JavaFX SDK as an external JAR to your project's build path.
    2. Adjust the run configurations to include the necessary VM arguments, as shown above for IntelliJ.

## Running the Application
Compile and run the `SpaceShooter.java` file. Ensure the VM options are set correctly to include the JavaFX library path and modules.

## How to Play
- Use the A, W, S, D keys or arrow keys to move the spaceship.
- Press SPACE to shoot at enemies.
- Avoid letting enemies reach the bottom of the screen or colliding with them.
- Collect power-ups to enhance your capabilities and increase your score.
- The game ends when all lives are lost, but you can start over by resetting the game.
